# DSA with JavaScript

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository implemented in **JavaScript**! This repository is designed to help developers and students sharpen their problem-solving skills and understand fundamental concepts of DSA.

## Table of Contents
- [Overview](#overview)
- [Why JavaScript?](#why-javascript)
- [Getting Started](#getting-started)
- [Topics Covered](#topics-covered)
- [How to Use](#how-to-use)
- [Contribution Guidelines](#contribution-guidelines)

## Overview
This repository includes various data structures and algorithms implemented in JavaScript. Each topic comes with its own explanation, followed by the code and, in some cases, examples of how to use the implementation in real-world scenarios.

Whether you are a beginner or preparing for coding interviews, this repo will help you:
- Understand how fundamental algorithms work.
- Get a clear idea of when and why to use certain data structures.
- Practice your problem-solving skills in JavaScript.

## Why JavaScript?
JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages today. While it's widely known for web development, it is also a great choice for learning DSA due to its:
- Ubiquity (can run both in the browser and server-side).
- Large ecosystem and community.
- Simple syntax and versatility.

## Getting Started
To use this repository, you'll need **Node.js** installed on your machine. Follow the instructions below to get started.

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-js.git
cd dsa-js
```

### 2. Run Algorithms
Each algorithm and data structure has its own folder. To run a specific algorithm or data structure:

```bash
node path/to/algorithm.js
```

For example:
```bash
node algorithms/sorting/quickSort.js
```

## Topics Covered
### Data Structures
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps

### Algorithms
- Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Dynamic Programming (Fibonacci, Knapsack Problem)
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking
- Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's)

Each section includes:
- **Explanation**: A brief introduction to the concept.
- **Code**: The JavaScript implementation of the data structure or algorithm.
- **Example**: A real-world example or use case.

## How to Use
1. Explore the topic you are interested in.
2. Read the explanation to understand how the algorithm or data structure works.
3. Study the code and run it to see how it functions.
4. Try modifying the code or solving a problem with it.

Feel free to use the code as a reference for solving your own coding challenges or interview problems!
